        <p>I'm Matt License, a (soon-to-be) London-based developer. I'm due to graduate Loughborough University in July 2014 with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
        <p>My main interest is web development, having spent the last few year primarily focused on PHP, I'm now expanding my horizons as I enter the real world of work, which is what this blog aims to cover.</p>
        <p>I've previously worked as a Software Engineer at Accenture on a year out from university - primarily maintaining a series of international websites based between Java and LAMP stacks. I'm due to start work at Nomura in September 2014.</p>
