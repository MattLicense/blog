I do actually plan on maintaining this blog. Having just finished my dissertation project - [a web-based data analysis tool][hugo] - I'm looking to start a side project, so I've decided to play around with Jekyll and GitHub pages to maintain a blog.

My dissertation project was an API and web application to allow users to generated reports (with the help of the [Google Charts API][g-charts]) from a single CSV file split by local authority (in England) and year to provide an overview of trends over a number of years. I've developed the API (almost) from scratch with the help of the [Symfony HTTP Foundation][http] components to help with request routing and developed the web application using [AngularJS][angular] and a couple of additions (such as [Angular Google Charts][a-g-charts]).

While I found the learning curve for Angular quite steep, by the end I found myself enjoying using it. This was the first time I've used any sort of object-oriented Javascript, but being reasonably familiar with concepts such as MVC helped.

With about 5 weeks until my last exam, I'm trying to plan out what I can learn before I start work in September. I'm currently planning on refreshing my Java, since it's been a while since I've done any serious Java development and it looks like I'll be using it at work; and I feel like Python would be a good language to learn.
